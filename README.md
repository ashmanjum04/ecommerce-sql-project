# 🛒 E-Commerce Backend Management System (SQL Project)

This is a complete **E-Commerce Backend Management System** created using **only SQL in SQLite** inside **Termux on Android**.  
It handles everything from user registration to orders, payments, and reviews, and we implemented advanced logic using views and real-world queries.

---

## 📂 Project Summary

- Built 6 main tables: Users, Products, Orders, OrderItems, Payments, Reviews  
- Inserted sample data for all tables  
- Performed all basic to advanced queries  
- Created multiple **views**  
- Added **10 new advanced features** to expand the project like real-world use cases

---

## 📌 Advanced Features Implemented

1. Top-selling products (with total sold and revenue)  
2. Frequent buyers (users who order the most)  
3. Revenue by category  
4. Monthly sales report  
5. Low-stock product alert  
6. Unpaid or failed orders  
7. Average rating per product  
8. User activity summary  
9. Payment success percentage  
10. Most reviewed products

👨‍💻 About This Project

This project is part of my SQL learning journey using Termux on Android

It helped me understand how real-world e-commerce systems work using only SQL

I added advanced queries and expanded features to simulate real backend logic

No frontend, no programming languages — just SQL and command line
